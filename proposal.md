# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I have been having trouble coming up with names, but some ideas I have are Owl-gabra, or Easy as Pi (probably Owl-gabra). I like math puns, so I will probably incorporate them into this a little.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A one-stop website for math class advice, recommended math resources, math checker, and more.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The website will have multiple pages, each with different math related resources as a go to website for basic math help. The website will be built using basic HTML and CSS. (It will be hand-coded, not using any of the web-building tools, so the code will be simple and clean.) The website will have four basic pages -- the home page, which will link out to other pages containing specific content. Depending upon the creation/evolution of this content, there may be additional links to external sources, and there may be user-input with scripted responses. The other pages will be as discussed below.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A website with pages dedicated to 1) math class advice (i.e. what to expect for different classes and good things to know going into them), 2) tutorial videos with recommended creators, and 3) algebra skills quizzes.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A website with pages dedicated to 1) math class advice (i.e. what to expect for different classes and good things to know going into them), 2) tutorial videos with recommended creators, 3) algebra skills quizzes, and 4) different math widgits.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A website with pages dedicated to 1) math class advice (i.e. what to expect for different classes and good things to know going into them), 2) tutorial videos with recommended creators, 3) algebra skills quizzes, 4) different math widgits, and 5) step-by-step checker with correction instructions for certain types of problems.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I am learning from someone previously knowledgeable in HTML/CSS to learn these foundational markup skills and will build this site. I will use both my reference person and their library, as well as online sites such as w3schools.com, to build the site. As far as specifics, I will first design the site, identifying and creating the content of each page. I will then create these pages. I will focus more on functionality than design, so I will do what I can, but I am more focused on the content currently and how to actually build the site, rather than the look of it. 

If I have time, I may then re-create the sites using a WYSIWYG tool such as Dreamweaver to work with more styling tools. (I have access to Dreamweaver through my reference person.)
