Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

The base website has been built, along with multiple pages. I have created a locally hosted site, consisting of 5 pages so far. The homepage describes the content of the site and welcomes the user. There are currently 3 content based pages. The first is course reviews, which includes a prototype form for user submission. Note that without an underlying structure, any content submitted through the form is not actually submitted anywhere, or displayed. The tutorials page has been made and has links to recommended videos and creators, sorted by topic. I am currently working on the quizzes page. I have the quizzes coded in Python, but am just working on figuring out how to use that in the website. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet integrated the interactive quizzes, as I have stated above. If I do figure this out in a timely manner, I will also be working on adding an additional content page for a basic step by step math checker. I would also like to style the site a bit more if I have extra time after creating the content.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The learning curve has been a bit rough. Specifically, learning how to integrate python scripts when hardcoding the site HTML. I am fairly confident that I will be able to figure this out. However, if I am not, I will come up with some different ideas for those pages.
