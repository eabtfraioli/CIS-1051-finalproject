    <td valign=top>Prof. A</td>
    <td valign=top>This class was my first math class at Temple, and it was a great first one to have! It is all about derivatives. The topics can be a little challenging when first getting started, but everything in this class has a pattern. Professor A was amazing at teaching this course! If you really like understanding the why behind each concept, Professor A is the professor for you! A great way to prepare for this class is to go over basic math concepts, so when you are working through the more difficult problems, you don’t lose points for silly mistakes. </td>

    <td valign=top>Calc II was a bit more challenging than Calc I, mostly because of sequences and series. The first half of the class was on integrals, which is just the opposite of Calc I, but the second half is series tests, which are a lot to handle. My best advice for this class is to really stay on top of studying. Flash cards helped me a lot when I was trying to memorize each different test, or integration method. I had Prof. B, who is great at exposing you to different types/difficulties of problems. The only downside is that we were a little behind in the end because we went through so many questions. </td>

    <td valign=top>Prof. C</td>
    <td valign=top>Don’t let the name mislead you; Basic Concepts is by far the most difficult course I have taken so far at Temple. This is an introductory proofs class, so the ideas themselves are fairly simple, but the way of thinking them through is very different. For example, the way to prove that a number is odd is if it can be written in the form 2n+1. It makes sense, but is a different way of thinking, so just be aware of that coming into this class. Professor C knew what he was talking about, but was very particular about how things were phrased. Make sure to be deliberate in your proofs, or you will lose a lot of points.

    <td valign=top>Prof. D</td>
    <td valign=top>Calc III is, in my opinion, a little harder than Calc I, but not as hard as Calc II. Basically, it takes Calc I and II concepts, and puts them into 3 dimensions. One of the hardest parts is just visualizing the shape you are working with. For this class, I would really suggest doing as many practice problems as you can, and try not to fall behind. Because the class is going over both differentiation, integration, and more, if you miss a concept, it will be pretty hard to go back to it. Professor D was a good professor, but sometimes it would be frustrating as he would not completely go through a problem, and just assume we knew how to complete it. To prepare for this class, just review Calc I and II, and you should be good to go. </td>

    <td valign=top>Prof. E</td>
    <td valign=top>This class is split in two halves: linear algebra, and differential equations. For me, linear algebra was incredibly difficult. Some concepts I was able to quickly pick up on, but for the more theoretical stuff, it was very hard. This is definitely a class that I would suggest studying hard for. The quizzes and exams are fair, though, as they are very similar to suggested homework questions. Differential equations was more understandable to me, as it was just like a twisted version of Calc. Remembering derivative and integral rules really helped. Professor E was such a great professor, and was always so excited to teach each topic. If you have trouble in this class, let him know, and he will help you. </td></td>

    <td valign=top>Dr. Spock</td>
    <td valign=top>While Dr. Spock obviously knows his stuff, his oral communication skills are limited. For instance, his entire explanation of Chapter 2, "Adding things together" consisted of saying, "add it up." Groan. He then covered the entire board with hieroglyphics in about 3 seconds flat. Ugh. No explanations, no real teaching.</td>

    <td valign=top>OMG, Dr. Spock is the absolute BEST! His brilliance in explaining abstract concepts is only exceeded by his ability to prove the impossible! I can't believe I haven't had other courses from him, but will certainly take any and all other classes he offers. Wow!</td>
