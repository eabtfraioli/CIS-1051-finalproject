# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Code a website that provides math tutoring, fun tips, what different classes are like, resources, and other fun math stuff.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am working alone for this project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I have never made a website before, so I am not very sure where to start. What would be some good things to look at to learn how to do this?
